# discord-bot
a discord bot for testing simple commands , it has a simple webserver get function for pinging it so that it can stay online for longer and i have implemented a repl.it config to easily run it on repl.it ,  just include a .env file with BOT_TOKEN as the environment variable for the discord bot token
